Flight Tracker

A Python project to track flight data using an API.

Overview

This project is intended to track flights and display relevant flight data. Currently, it fetches data from an API, but there are some limitations:

The API is not working for the next few days/weeks.

The current implementation is a work-in-progress and above my current skill level, but I wanted to document how far I’ve gotten so far.

Current Status

The project can fetch and process some flight data (depending on API availability).

I plan to completely remake the flight_data handling once the API is stable again.

This is an early-stage project, and some parts are incomplete or may not work as expected.

Future Plans

Rework the flight_data system to make it more robust.

Improve code structure and readability.

Add more features once I have a better grasp of the required concepts.

Usage

Currently, usage may be limited due to API availability. I recommend checking the code and following along as I continue development.
